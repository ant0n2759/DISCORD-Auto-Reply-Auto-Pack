# DISCORD-Auto-Reply-Auto-Pack
A simple python script that lets you reply instantly to any user you want, with any message you want. So long as you can see the message &amp; reply, it doesn't matter what server or channel they speak in. I'm js sharing this for convenience cz ik not everyone knows how to do basic stuff like this so yw.

## How to setup:
1. Install basic python, any recent-ish version will work post 3.10
2. Install asyncio & discord packages for python via PIP by opening command prompt and typing:

   `pip install asyncio` and `pip install discord`
3. Start the script by opening it by double clicking the file or via IDLE. 

## Information it needs:
1. First, enter the token of the account you want to post the replies from. You can find how to get your discord token [here](https://linuxhint.com/get-discord-token/).
   
   Note: If you're worried this program will steal your token, just read the code. It has like, what, 30 lines? If you cant understand it then dont use it.
2. Then you enter the message you want to respond with, can be anything including image links if you want.
3. Lastly, enter the discord ID of the person you want to autoreply to. You can see how to get that [here](https://www.alphr.com/discord-find-user-id/).

##  Extra Stuff:
if you skid this little code i rlly fuckin hope you rethink ur life choices lmao. it took me longer to write this readme than it did that script
